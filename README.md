# ConfigureAwaitVSExtension

A Visual Studio extension that warn to configure an awaiter in await calls

‚ö†Ô∏è this branch is for VS2019 only ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Motivation

We always forget the `ConfigureAwait(...)`, so this extension warns us about this and fixes it! üòé
I made this project just for fun. I'm sure there are some edge cases that I didn't take into account
Meanwhile, enjoy it! üòâ

## About the code

I used the Visual Studio Extensibility Template _Analyzer with Code Fix (.NET Standard)_.
In theory, this extension can be deployed as either a NuGet package or a VSIX extension.
It was tested using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Version 15.9.11

### The `ConfigureAwaitAnalyzer`

It only runs if there are no compilation errors.
It analyzes the `AwaitExpressionSyntax` nodes and check if their `string` representation ends with the text `"ConfigureAwait([true|false])"`
That's it, just that

### The `ConfigureAwaitAnalyzerCodeFixProvider`

It modifies the `AwaitExpressionSyntax`'`ExpressionNode` in order to add the `ConfigureAwait([true|false])` expression nodes:

![asd](https://i.ibb.co/W2TzLsh/Await-Expression-Tree.png)

this way we make the fix.
There are two code fixes: 'Add `ConfigureAwait(false)`' and 'Add `ConfigureAwait(true)`'

## Todos

- Check edge cases like:

  ```csharp
  var task = MethodAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
  var result = await task;  // <- this generates an unnecesary warning
                ~~~~~~~~~~~
  ```

- Maybe do something smarter than just check the suffix on the `string` representation
- Allow user settings to:
  - activate/deactivate the extension
  - change if the extension should report Warnings or Errors
